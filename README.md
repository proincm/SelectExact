See how the `getPartners` method and string `Partners` did not get selected?

### Why?
Sublime Text offered a great visual on the exact matches, this mostly could be a variable name, class name or some text in the same meaning. While Sublime Text multiple selection is great, it still a pain to exclude all the thing that does not relevant as it appear on the view. That is why this plugin is created.

### How?
For quick add next occurrence, press `Command+Shift+D` (OS X) or `Ctrl+Shift+D` (Windows/Linux).

For add all occurrences, press `Command+Ctrl+Option+G` (OS X) or `Super+Ctrl+Alt+G` (Windows/Linux).
